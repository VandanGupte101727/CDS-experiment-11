AIM:-to study and implement classes and objects<br>

Software used:- VS code<br>

Theory:-<br>
In C++, the paradigm known as "Object-Oriented Programming" (OOP) is based on the idea that objects are just instances of classes. OOP is centered around four key ideas:

Encapsulation is the process of combining methods (functions) that manipulate data with data (attributes) into a single unit known as a class. This presents simply a controlled interface, concealing the internal state of the objects.<br>
Inheritance: A mechanism that encourages code reuse by allowing a new class (derived) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base).
The ability to consider objects of multiple classes as objects of a common base class is known as polymorphism, and it is very helpful for writing reusable and adaptable code.<br>
Abstraction: Modeling relevant classes for a given problem while disregarding unimportant features in order to simplify complex reality.<br>
